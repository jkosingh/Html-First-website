<h1>Vancouver Canucks </h1>
<time> 5/25/2015 </time>
<p> 2014 results: First round playoff exit. </p>
<br></br>
<h2><u> Free Agency </u></h2>
<p> As this season concluded, Canucks fans have to be feeling very 'meh' about how their team did this year. It wasn't the complete disaster that last year was, but it wasn't a cup run either. Last year the Canucks seemed to get everyone they wanted out of free agency. Getting the prize forward Radim Vrbata and Ryan Miller were huge splashes that contributed greatly to the Canucks making the playoffs this year. This year the Canucks need to do the impossible again and convince solid contributors to come play for a team who wants to be a playoff contender once again. The Canucks will need to address their need for a top two centre as well as the ageing of their back end. Another goalie move also seems to happen as the teams ahl utica comets will most likely not have goaltender Jacob Markstrom this year. </p>
<h2><u> Second line centre </u></h2>
<p> The Canucks, if they can, should target Antoine Vermette. Vermette, traded from Arizona to Chicago at the trade deadline is a two-way forward who is known for his defensive ability as well as his great face off percentage over his career. Chicago almost has no way to resign him this summer as they will have to deal with a lot of cap issues of their own, including the possibility of trading a staple player of their own, <em> for example Crawford, Seabrook or most likely Sharp </em>. Vermette would also join his former team-mate Vrbata in Vancouver, most likely both delagated to the second line as Dejardins has invisioned a big shoot-first player to play with the Sedins next season; something Vrbata is not.</p>
<p>  Other options include:
 <ul>
  <li>ReSigning either Sean Matthias or Brad Richardson for the right price</li>
  <li>Brad Richards. For a million dollar try-out</li>
  <li>Carl Soderberg. Cause hey yknow the Canucks can't get enough Swedish berries and it's not like the Bruins can afford him</li>
  <li> Mike Fisher. Cause even if he's a bust, we still get Carrie Underwood in the package </li>
</ul>  </p>
<h2><u> Top four defenseman </u></h2>
 <p> As for a young d-man the Canucks should try to pick up Jeff Petry from Montreal. Petry, also a trade deadline acquisition, was put in a bad situation in Edmonton so his bad numbers should not be looked at and valued so heavily. At the right price, Petry, who is 6'3 and and good offensive defenceman could fit in nicely for the Canucks in a top 4 defenceman role. This could also open up the Canucks to dump some of their more pesky contracts before they become poisonous. Bieksa and Hamhuis gotta know they will be asked to waive those no movement clauses. Petry played No. 3 minutes for the Canadiens so expect him to play the second line.  </p>
 <p>  Other options include:
 <ul>
  <li>Mike Green. Yes he'll be expensive. Yes he's getting old. Why do the Canucks need him? He'll bring size and grit to the back end and make Bieksa that much more expendable.</li>
  <li>Cody Franson. Call it a comeback or whatever else but he's still young and has expressed interest in playing in Vancouver, hopefully this means we'll also get a hometown discount, otherwise the Canucks shouldn't take this risk.</li>
  <li>Francois Beauchemin. Yes another old guy, but a reliable workhorse one that the Ducks are pushing out. Whether he's interested maybe the bigger question.</li>
  <li> Andrej Sekera. A steady two-way defenceman that would fit nicely on the second line especially since LA can't afford to resign him.  </li>
</ul>  </p>
