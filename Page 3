<h1>Contracts/ Prospects</h1>
<p> Canucks are not a team loaded with young potential, but the last couple years has been kind to the team and with the firing of Nonis, The contracts don't look too bad either. Here's a bit on both. </p>
<p> Contracts:
 <ul>
  <li>Sedin's are still the highest paid on this team both coming in a 7 mill each for three more years.And that's including the two for one coupon</li>
  <li>Ryan Miller: cashed in last season with a 6 million contract for two more years</li>
  <li>Radim Vrbata: Also was gifted to the Canucks for 5 million last summer, pretty decent money eh? </li>
  <li> Alexandre Burrows. Stands at 4.5 mill for the next two years and for a degenerating forward this is one of those toxic contracts the Canucks probably would like a re do on. On a scale of one to Loungo, Burrows contract is about peaking at Bure levels of bad.</li>
  <li> Higgins and Hanson both come in at a respectable 2.5 million, not even enough to live in Vancouver these days.
  <li> Bonino and Kassian make about the same 1.9 and 1.75 million respectable lets just hope one is not overpaid and the other doesn't bust in the future. I'll let you guess which one is which.
  <li> Alex Edler will make 5 million for the next 4 seasons cause why not right? Actually this one I can live with as the salary cap is set to rise, but imagine that much for the player who showed up 2 years ago and is constantly injured? Yuck.
  <li> Bieksa and Hamhuis, once thought to be the pieces needed to win a cup for Vancouver getting paid 4.5 and 4.6 million respectably living proof the NHL really is a young man's sport.
  
</ul> </p>
 <p> Prospects: 
<ul>
  <li>Bo Horvat: The exciting 19 year old forward was fun to watch last year and showed off some great skills and hockey sense for the future of the Canucks. If he can get his strength up and keep up the work ethic expect him top tap out at a future second line centre in the not too distant future.</li>
  <li>Hunter Shinkaruk: Here's a kid who's a pure goal scoring machine drawing comparisons to Kucherov or Drouin of the Tampa Bolts. He's fast and has a nose for the net, but with himself being undersized and lacking the hockey sence of an actual NHL player still, expect him to stay in the AHL next year. Yes he's got the potential, lets see if he puts in the work.</li>
  <li>Jake Virtanen: Selected pretty high and having a great CHL Virtanen will look to make the jump to the NHL this year. He's inexperienced yes, and he will definitely make mistakes, but he has a high ceiling and keeping him in the AHL next season may stunt that a bit. He's got the size and the puck skills. He'll mak the team. </li>
  <li> Brendan Gaunce: drafted 24th overall a couple years ago, Gaunce is your standard 2-way forward. He'll definitely be getting looks toward the NHL team next year, but look for him to play the top line in the AHL. Gaunce is a proven leader and great motivator look for him to play second or third line center in the not too distant future.</li>  
  <li> Thatcher Demko: The only goalie on this list, Thatcher is a respectable goalie playing in Europe as of right now. Undersized, but incredibly fast, he draws comparisons to guy like Robin Lehener expect him to be a solid backup in about 4 years. Demko's future is an uncertain one, but that of itself could work in his favor.  </li>
  <li> Linden Vey: A streaky scorer in the AHL turned confused defensive and position lacking forward in the NHL. Vey needs guidance. I wouldn't call him a write off just yet, if the Canucks retain him, look for the coach to change up his linemates or even his position. A shift to the AHL this soon may break him. </li>
  <li> Nicklas Jensen: The Danish Thunder is 6'3 and ready to make his first full season in the NHL this year. Jensen has had the skills for at least a couple years now and if he's added more to his defensive ability last year in the AHL that wouldn't hurt either. Expect him in the starting 12. </li>
  <li> Dane Fox: Often not talked about, Dane Fox has never been given a full shot at the NHL level, but has been an absolute goal machine in the AHL, but terribly defensively. With the right guidance expect him to be a third line or fourth line guy and a few years. </li>
