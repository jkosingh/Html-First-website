<h1><u>Possible Trades </u></h1>
<p> Trade speculation surrounds the Canucks as they head into the offseason this summer. Almost everybody not a prospect or named Sedin is up for grabs potentially as the Canucks are not looking to blow up their organization, but if offered the right trade would be smart to pull the trigger. </p>
 <br></br>
 <h2><u> Forwards </u></h2>
 <p> The Canucks are not known for a lot of depth up at forward so potentially adding pieces via trade seems like a good option, but that doesn't mean there are not any Canuck forwards on the trading block. Alexandre Burrows had a solid bounce back season with the Canucks after a horrendous outing with <em> He who shall not be Named </em> a year before. The Caucks would be wise to use Burrows as trade bait and ship him off for a package or at very least a draft high draft pick. Chris Higgins is getting older, but his contract is still pretty cheap for the skilled left winger. With the Canucks having prospect depth on the wing, expect Higgins to also find his name on the block. Vrbata, the Canucks prize from last years draft has also seen his name being floated around the wire as teams looking for a gifted play making winger, <strong> I'm looking at you Washington </strong> look no further. Albeit old and expensive winger, but for a team desperate enough to pull the trigger the Canucks shouldn't miss potential future opportunities.
 <br></br>
 <h2><u> Defence </u></h2>
 <p> The Canucks defence could potentially be completely re done this off season as everyone excluding Tanev and Edler seems to be expendable. As mentioned before, Bieksa and Hamhuis will most likely be asked to waive their no movement clause. Both are getting up their in years and haven't been preforming up to their contracts for at least 2. Luca Sbisa, even though signing a long term contract this year has also got to be considered to be on the chopping block. Ever since coming over to the Canucks in the infamous Kesler deal with Anaheim, fans haven't seemed to take to his playing style and Sbisa often finds himself criticized heavily in losses. If the right deal came around for Alex Edler I wouldn't be surprised either, as after having a comeback year selling him high could fetch the Canucks quite a bit. </p> 
 <br></br>
 <h2><u> Goalie</u></h2> 
 <p> It wouldn't feel much like an article on the Canucks if their wasn't a goalie controversy. It seems ever since the days of Dan Cloutier and Alex Auld the Canucks have never had a clear no. 1 and no.2 goaltender. They were even so boneheaded to doubt the great Roberto Luongo and for their efforts will still pay him 800,000 for eternity. The Canucks overpaid Ryan Miller quite a bit to come to Vancouver, even with the known potential of Eddie Lack and the untradeable Jonas Markstrom. Ryan Miller had a sub par season and was showed up by backup Lack, but with 2 years left on a 6 million dollar contract, he isn't going anywhere anytime soon. One of the three gotta go. Not Lack; but knowing the Canucks, it'll be Lack shown the door.
